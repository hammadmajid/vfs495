# VFS495 open driver — project status & reverse-engineering reference

A distilled, organized digest of the project's established facts, the reverse
engineering of HP's binary, and the current state of the open driver. For the
chronological, dated reasoning and evidence behind every claim here, see
[`../NOTES.md`](../NOTES.md). For build and usage, see [`../README.md`](../README.md).

Status as of 2026-10-01: **the open secure session, transport, EP2 image decryption
and per-session calibration run in open Rust with no HP code, live on hardware.**
A feeder daemon bridges to libfprint for GNOME/fprintd. A user swipe now
yields a real fingerprint image (session 10; earlier "real print" / "enrolls +
verifies" claims from held-finger captures were noise self-matching). The
former blocker — the no-finger ridge baseline drifting into the finger range — is
fixed (session 10): calibration is now computed per session from our own sweep
frames (open ports of HP's step functions). Finger detection now gates on contact rows. Next: live enroll with swipes (§0).

---

## 0. Resume here (session 10, 2026-10-01)

**Where we are:** the no-finger drift blocker is **fixed**. Each capture session now
runs its own AFE calibration (`src/calib.rs`): the three steps whose results vary
(PgaOffset, Adc, PgaGain) are computed from our own sweep frames with byte-exact
ports of HP's step functions and carried into every later command, exactly as HP
does. Live, no finger, 7 sessions: computed PgaOffset=5, Adc=130–133, PgaGain=6 (the
same values HP picks) and **ridge_peak 1.07–1.25** (stale replay gave 1.6–2.7).

Two bugs fixed on the way:
- **EP2 line loss.** The reply wait alternated 20 ms on EP1 / 20 ms on EP2; the
  sensor's EP2 FIFO (~14 lines) overflowed during each EP1 wait and ~27 lines were
  dropped, corrupting every sweep frame (and the image stream). EP2 is now read by
  a scoped thread for the whole reply wait; sweep frames arrive gap-free.
- **Stale calibration replay** (the drift root cause, see NOTES 2026-10-01).

**MAJOR CORRECTION (session 10, after the user's finger test):** the fully-open
path has **never produced a real fingerprint image**. Finger held → ridge_peak 1.42
(marginal), and objectively every open-path image — old "finger" captures included —
has orientation coherence ~0.09 (pure noise) vs 0.87 for the HP-harvested print
(`captures/fingerprint_open.png`). So the earlier "real print", "finger ~2.1", and
"enrolls + verifies through libfprint" claims are falsified (noise self-matches).
See NOTES 2026-10-01 "CORRECTION".

**FIRST REAL PRINT FROM THE FULLY-OPEN PATH (2026-10-01):** a user **swipe**
through `vfs495 capture` decodes to a clear fingerprint (loop core), ridge
coherence 0.98 (HP's print 0.87–0.90, noise 0.09), 6258 contact rows (no finger: 0).
Root causes of the earlier "all noise" images: press-and-hold on a swipe sensor, and
`image::normalize` subtracting the per-column mean over ALL rows (erases a finger
held still). Decode was always correct; `06 06`/`07 07` headers are the PgaGain echo.

**Gate replaced:** the daemon/`ridge-probe` now gate on **contact rows**
(`--min-contact`, default 300; row sd ≥ 25 after a per-column-median background).
Live: no finger 0 rows (that same capture had ridge_peak 2.51 — the old gate would
have falsely fired). ridge_peak is printed as a diagnostic only. All prompts now say
SWIPE.

**Swipe reconstruction (session 10):** raw swipes were ~6-10x vertically stretched
(the sensor scans faster than a finger moves). `image::reconstruct_swipe` keeps a row
only once the finger has moved (diff >= 0.35 x run median contact sd), giving natural
~200x215-275 prints (user swipe and HP's recorded swipe). A touch without motion is
refused by `run`/daemon. Cues now print exactly at each imaging window:
"DO NOT TOUCH" → "SWIPE NOW (1 of 2)" → "SWIPE NOW (2 of 2)" → "Done".

**Live enroll (2026-10-02):** 5/5 enroll stages accepted from 5 real swipes, but
**different swipes do not match** (offline leave-one-out on 6 saved swipes: 0/6
genuine; control self-match OK). Cause: swipe speed. The threshold de-stretch gives
each swipe a different vertical scale (pairwise 0.70-1.40) and uneven distortion.

**NEXT ACTION (offline, no user needed):** port HP's swipe reconstructor
(`IRreconstructImage` @0x468ff0, `vcsImageGetSwipeSpeed`, `DecideSpeed`) to replace
`reconstruct_swipe`'s threshold; validate by isotropy + cross-swipe scale ≈1 + the
leave-one-out match. Then one more `scripts/live_enroll.py` run by the user.

**Sensor access note:** the udev rule is installed (`user:bine:rw-`); it survives
re-enumeration. If the sensor gets wedged, a full power-off (not just reboot) clears
its state. Back-to-back `ridge-probe` runs can still re-enumerate (per-run session;
diagnostic only) — space them a few seconds apart.

## 1. Target and constraints

- **Sensor:** Validity VFS495 ("Falcon"), USB `138a:003f`, HP EliteBook 820 G3
  and other 2015-era HP laptops. `bcdDevice 1.04`. Endpoints: EP1 IN/OUT bulk 64,
  EP2 IN bulk 64 (image), EP3 IN interrupt 8.
- **Repo:** git at `~/Developer/lab/vfs495`, remote `origin`
  (github.com/hammadmajid/vfs495). HP's package and all extractions live in
  `vendor/` (gitignored, never committed). Biometric captures, raw USB traces, and
  HP patch blobs are also gitignored — keep them out of commits since the repo is
  published.
- **Do not**, without explicit user OK: send `TakeOwnership` / `setowner` /
  `resetowner` (persistent, cycle-limited sensor writes), or change system
  fprintd / PAM / authselect / GDM config.

---

## 2. Key established facts

### Secure session (SSLv3-RSA)
- The sensor wraps every command in a **proprietary variant of SSLv3-RSA**
  (cipher suite `0x0044` = AES-256-CBC + SHA-1).
- Prior art (saifulmd0/vfs495-linux) hit fatal alert **`0x2f`** because on an
  **owned** sensor the `ClientKeyExchange` wraps the premaster secret in
  `AES-256-CBC(s_key)` before RSA, where `s_key` is a 32-byte DH-derived shared
  secret set at pairing.
- **This sensor is UNOWNED** (`get_ownership_info` → 65535/65535 cycles left). On
  an unowned sensor the `s_key` wrap is skipped, so a **standard open SSLv3
  client establishes the session with no pairing at all** — the wall every prior
  VFS495 project hit. Proven live in Rust (`vfs495 handshake` → CCS + Finished,
  no alert).
- The sensor's RSA pubkey (2048-bit, `e=65537`) modulus is in
  `captures/modulus.json`. The sensor ships the pubkey in an opaque signed key
  blob on EP2 during init (no clean TLV/length anchor → kept file-based per
  device; dump with `scripts/dump_modulus.gdb.py`).

### Pairing (not needed here, fully mapped)
- **Pairing = "TakeOwnership"**: cmd `0x0f` (DH → `s_key`) + cmd `0x2c` (host RSA
  keypair). Reversible via `ResetOwnership`; 65535 ownership cycles. Credentials
  are stored host-side in `/etc/ValidityPersistentData` (GSKGlobal-wrapped),
  keyed by sensor serial. Not implemented — this sensor is unowned.

### Reply format
- In-session replies are plain SSLv3 AppData records (`17 03 00 <len> <ct>`) on
  EP1 — no tunnel (the `0x11` tunnel is handshake-only). Decrypted reply
  plaintext = **`u16 LE status` + optional payload**. `0x0000` / `0x0412` = OK;
  any status with bit `0x0400` set = error. A bare ack is 2 bytes (`00 00`).
- The earlier "capture is a blocked, un-replayable interactive protocol"
  conclusion was an artifact of misparsing the 2-byte status ack. The polls work.

### Capture command stream
- Capture is driven by replaying HP's in-session command sequence
  (`captures/capture_seq.json`, gitignored device data; a list of plaintext
  command-hex strings extracted from an HP `scsSend` trace). Each command is
  re-encrypted with **our** session keys — no HP ciphertext is reused.
- 42-command sequence: `1f` setup; calibration block (`1a`/`06`/`02` sweep
  frames, ~idx 0–15, term `0x12`); then the poll/imaging loop (`0x02` polls,
  then `0x17`/`0x04` imaging latch, then `0x02` imaging bursts).
- Commands `0..23` all return status `0x0000` OK on a clean session.

---

## 3. The EP2 image transform (the final unlock)

The raw EP2 imaging stream is **AES-256-CBC encrypted** (entropy ~8, no SSL
framing). The frames that decode to a fingerprint (`01fe`-framed, 272-byte
stride) only appear *after* decryption. This is what made a raw live capture
show "too few lines" until session 5.

- **Cipher:** `scsSensorDecryptFingerprint@0x4fd640` → `palCryptoAesCbc`. IV
  chains across EP2 reads (last 16 ciphertext bytes → next IV); decrypt is
  in-place. Key length comes from the SSL suite (=32).
- **Key source:** NOT the SSL session key. HP generates a **fresh random 32-byte
  key and IV per capture** in `_scsSensorFpEncInit@0x4eb7f0` (`palCryptoRng`).
- **Key delivery:** `scsGetSecurityParams@0x4fd740` packs them **in the clear**
  (no RSA wrap) into a SecurityParams TLV embedded in the `0x02` GetFingerprint
  command, sent inside the already-SSL-encrypted channel:

  | field | offset in TLV value | size |
  |-------|--------------------|------|
  | AES-256 key | `0x00` | 32 |
  | IV (16 used) | `0x20` | 32 |
  | sign/HMAC key | `0x40` | 32 |
  | cipher selector (`0x04` = AES-256) | `0x68` | 1 |

  TLV header = tag `0x0006` (LE) + length `0x6a` (LE), i.e. `06 00 6a 00`.

- **Why replay works:** we replay HP's exact command bytes, so the sensor
  encrypts EP2 with HP's key — which is sitting in plaintext in those same bytes.
  We read it back and decrypt. In `capture_seq.json`, commands `3/17/22/23/26/27/41`
  carry the TLV; imaging commands `23` and `27` also carry a populated sign key.
- **Proven:** decrypting the imaging burst with the command's key yields clean
  `01fe` frames at 272 stride (frame-type `07 07`; the `06`/`07` byte is a mode
  marker the open unpack ignores) → a real fingerprint. Wrong key → noise.
- The image **signature** (sign key + `_scsSensorFpSignUpdate`) is an integrity
  HMAC over the image; not needed to obtain pixels, currently ignored.

---

## 4. Image decode (open, byte-exact)

`src/image.rs` is a clean-room reimplementation of HP's `UnpackLineRT`
(`0x46f510`) plus line assembly and reconstruction:

- **Modes:** mode 8 = `dst[perm[i]] = src[i]` (8-bit direct + descramble scatter);
  mode 4 = nibble expand; general = variable-bit per-column (bits at `cfg+8`,
  left-justify `<< (8-w)`, perm scatter at `cfg+0x57c`).
- **This device:** main image frames are **mode 8, width 264**, on-wire `01fe` +
  8-byte header + 264 payload = **stride 272**. Descramble table
  `captures/perm_264.bin` = `reverse(0..199) ++ reverse(200..263)`.
- **Config** (`captures/dli_config.json`) confirmed on-device with
  `scripts/dump_dli_config.gdb.py` (mode 8, width 264, max_bits 8; perm is a
  valid permutation of 0..263).
- **Verified byte-exact:** `scripts/dump_unpack_pairs.gdb.py` — the open
  `dst[perm[i]] = src[i]` unpack reproduces HP's `UnpackLineRT` output on 95/95
  real image lines, 0 mismatches.
- Reconstruction: fixed-pattern removal + ridge bandpass + finger-segment crop +
  motion-resample + local-contrast normalize → PGM.

## 5. Reverse-engineered HP functions (binary has debug symbols)

`vendor/runtime/bin/validity-sensor-unlocked` (built by
`scripts/build_harness.sh` with OpenSSL-0.9.8 stubs; not stripped).

| function | addr | role |
|----------|------|------|
| `scsSend` | `0x4f7bd0` | VCSFW wire framing `[cmd byte][payload]` |
| `scsSensorSendGetFingerprint_V4` | `0x5065f0` | builds the `0x02` poll/capture command |
| `scsSensorParseReply_V4` | `0x506340` | reply status decode (LE) |
| `idsSensorWOEFingerprintPoll` | `0x456320` | WOE finger-poll loop (poll-then-watch) |

| `irDliRTFalconData` | `0x462350` | frame demux/assembly (scans `01fe`) |
| `UnpackLineRT` | `0x46f510` | line unpack/descramble |

HP tracing harness verbs: `getver`, `get_ownership_info`, `getprintwait`,
`setowner` (writes!). Always `-doinit`.

## 6. Rust driver (crate `vfs495`, MIT, at repo root)

| module | responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `src/crypto.rs` | SSLv3 KDF, RSA (LE modulus, PKCS#1 v1.5), length-less MAC, AES-256-CBC record layer, `decrypt_image_stream` (EP2). Byte-exact vs `captures/skey_dump.json` (`vfs495 selftest`). |
| `src/usb.rs` | libusb transport (rusb): EP1 OUT/IN, EP2 image; `read_record` / `read_record_split`; kernel-driver detach/reattach. |
| `src/session.rs` | init replay + open SSLv3 handshake → active record layer. |
| `src/capture.rs` | in-session command replay, EP2 decrypt, `arm_capture` (full imaging capture → decrypted stream), `poll_probe` diagnostic. |
| `src/image.rs` | `UnpackLineRT` port, descramble, assembly, reconstruction → PGM; `ridge_peak`, `median_line_std`. |
| `src/virtimage.rs` | feed a decoded image to `$FP_VIRTUAL_IMAGE`. |
| `src/main.rs` | CLI: `selftest`, `handshake`, `capture`, `poll-probe`, `ridge-probe`, `decode`, `decode-lines`, `feed`, `run`, `daemon`. |

Toolchain: `libusb1-devel`; non-root USB via `packaging/70-vfs495.rules`.
6 unit tests pass; clippy-clean.

### Transport fix (session 4)
The `0x17`/`0x04` imaging latch made EP2 stream data; blocking on an EP1 reply
while EP2 was undrained starved the FIFO and reset the sensor (`-108`), which
looked like a USB re-enumeration. The fix interleaves EP2 draining with the EP1
reply wait (`read_record_split`, `drain_image_bounded`, `read_reply_interleaved`,
`send_cmd_draining`). Live result: all 42 commands OK, no reset, stable USB
address. (The old "the imaging latch re-enumerates the sensor" premise was false
— HP images a full swipe on one stable address; the old usblog "R(err)" were EP2
read cancels, not USB resets.)

### Falsified hypotheses (with evidence, so we don't revisit)
- `set_active_configuration` on reopen — the kernel sets config anyway.
- HP vendor control-plane resume on reopen — none; all standard kernel/hub
  enumeration.
- resend-`0x04` / SSL seq-continuity across a reset — the session was genuinely
  gone (zeros, not an alert). Moot once the re-enum was shown to be our bug.

---

## 7. Feeder daemon and GNOME integration

`vfs495 daemon` bridges the open capture path to libfprint's `virtual_image`
driver, so the sensor works through stock **fprintd / PAM / GDM / sudo** with no
custom C driver. The enroll → match → reject round-trip through libfprint is
proven in `scripts/vimage_proof.py`.

**Finger detection — ridge gate (the sensor streams high-variance imaging noise
even with no finger, so contrast, line count, and the segmentation crop all fail
to gate; only the ridge spectral peak works).** Each cycle the daemon fires a full
imaging capture (`arm_capture`), decodes it, and accepts it as a finger iff the
reconstructed image's **ridge spectral peak-to-mean** clears `--min-ridge`. That
is the sole gate. Measured live 2026-09-28 with the `ridge-probe` diagnostic:

| capture | ridge_peak | crop_ratio | verdict @1.4 |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| no finger | **1.21** | 0.857 | reject ✓ |
| finger (held) | **2.10** | 0.995 | accept ✓ |

- `ridge_peak` separates cleanly (noise ~1.1–1.2, finger ~1.8–2.1); the default
  `--min-ridge 1.4` sits between them.
- `crop_ratio` is **not** a finger signal and was removed from the gate: a held
  finger covers nearly every line, so segmentation crops nothing (0.995 > the
  no-finger 0.857 — the wrong direction). It is logged for diagnostics only.
- Firing the imaging latch every cycle is safe (the "latch stresses the sensor"
  premise was falsified in §6, and HP images full swipes on one stable address).

Diagnostic: `vfs495 ridge-probe [--min-ridge N]` — captures, decodes, prints
`ridge_peak`/`crop_ratio`/line count and the daemon verdict without gating, and
writes a PGM. Run once with a finger and once without to compare / retune.

**Falsified and removed (2026-09-28): the WOE poll-divergence gate.** The former
`capture::capture_on_finger` polled `seq[17]` (0x02 GetFingerprint) and watched for
reply divergence from a no-finger baseline. Live test with a finger held firmly the
entire run showed that poll is **finger-blind**: reply byte-divergence stayed flat
at `nd = 2–4` and the pre-latch EP2 stayed a constant 5712 B at mean ≈127 / sd ≈74,
identical with and without contact. Replaying a captured poll returns a canned
reply plus free-running AFE noise; without the `0x17`/`0x04` imaging latch there is
no finger signal. The old "~10 byte baseline jitter" was measuring that noise. The
poll path, `--contact-nd`, and `--max-wait-polls` were deleted. If a low-power gate
is wanted later (to avoid imaging on empty cycles), investigate the **unused EP3
interrupt endpoint** or a dedicated WOE command — not a replayed swipe poll.
(`vfs495 poll-probe` remains as a diagnostic; its defaults were corrected to
`--prefix 17 --poll-idx 17` — index 16 is a `0x06` calibration command with a
constant reply and no EP2, the earlier off-by-one that read all zeros.)

Tunables: `--min-ridge` (1.4), `--gap`, `--once`. `VFS_NO_PROMPT=1` suppresses the
interactive capture prompt.

**To route the system fprintd through the bridge** (a system-config change the
user must opt into), add a systemd drop-in setting `FP_VIRTUAL_IMAGE` and run the
daemon — see the README "GNOME / fprintd integration" section.

---

## 8. Current status and remaining work

**Done and live-confirmed:**
- Open SSLv3 session and transport (no HP code in the session path).
- Full command replay with continuous EP2 draining, no sensor reset.
- AES-256-CBC EP2 image decryption (key recovered from the replayed command).
- Open decode + reconstruction → real fingerprint (264×623, ridge ~10.6 px).
- libfprint enroll/verify through `virtual_image` proven (`vimage_proof.py`).
- **Finger detection: ridge-peak gate, live-confirmed** (finger 2.10 vs no-finger
  1.21, threshold 1.4). Daemon rebuilt on it; the finger-blind WOE poll gate and
  the misleading crop-ratio condition were removed. See §7.
- **Our live capture enrolls and verifies through libfprint** (2026-09-28): a real
  live-path image (ridge_peak 2.10) enrolls all 5 stages, matches itself, and
  rejects a different print, driving libfprint directly via GObject introspection
  (same path as `vimage_proof.py`, no fprintd/PAM change). So the sensor's image
  contains genuine, usable minutiae.

**Image-size fix (2026-09-28):** libfprint rejects an over-tall image
("unrealistically large image, disconnecting client") *before* reading minutiae. A
**held** finger stacks the same region into a huge redundant strip (264×7867 in the
test) and was rejected outright; a normal finger-sized window of the same capture
enrolls/verifies fine (264×400 and 264×500 both PASS). `reconstruct` now clamps the
finger band to a central `MAX_FEED_ROWS` (500) window, so the daemon always feeds a
libfprint-acceptable, minutiae-friendly image. (A swipe assembles to a few-hundred
-line band and is unaffected; the clamp only bites the held-finger case.)

**Remaining:**
- **Re-confirm the finger-side ridge_peak** with the fixed stream + per-session
  calibration (no-finger is now 1.07–1.25 stably; finger was ~2.1 under the old,
  stale/gappy path). The old drift blocker is FIXED (session 10, §0): it was 4 stale
  calibration values in the replay, now computed per session in `src/calib.rs`.
  NOTE: `ridge_peak` is window-size dependent — it MUST be computed on the full
  image; `window_for_feed` clamps only the pixels sent to libfprint, after the gate.
- End-to-end **live** daemon enroll/verify with touches — unblocked; next. The image *substance* is proven (a real live capture enrolls all 5 stages
  and verifies through libfprint).
- fprintd systemd drop-in for `FP_VIRTUAL_IMAGE` — a user-opt-in system change.

**Done this session (10):**
- Per-session AFE calibration (`src/calib.rs`): byte-exact ports of
  `scsFalconCalPgaOffset` / `scsFalconCalAdc` / `scsFalconCalPgaGain`, each
  verified against 5 HP ground-truth runs (and HP's internal sum tables), with
  HP-style sweep-frame validation; results carried into later commands (47 sites).
- EP2 read on a scoped thread during reply waits — fixes ~27-line drops per gap.

**Done session 9:**
- **Session reuse fixes the re-enumeration.** The daemon opens + handshakes once
  and reuses the session across captures (rebuilding on a fault); 6 back-to-back
  no-finger cycles ran with 0 errors and a stable USB address. (`ridge-probe` still
  opens per-run, so repeated ridge-probes re-enumerate — diagnostic-only.)
- Fixed the `MAX_FEED_ROWS` clamp that broke the gate (it made `ridge_peak` be
  computed on the 500-row feed window, inflating no-finger to ~2.5). Gate is on the
  full image again; `window_for_feed` clamps only the fed pixels.
- Verify the open unpack is byte-exact for frame-type `07` (payload decodes to
  ridges, so almost certainly yes).
- Optional: a low-power gate via the unused **EP3 interrupt endpoint** to avoid
  imaging on empty cycles (currently every cycle images then gates on the picture).
- Owned-sensor pairing is mapped but unimplemented (not needed here).
- Per-device RSA modulus auto-extraction is not wired (dump per unit).

## 9. Diagnostic env gates (in the driver)

`VFS_NO_PROMPT` (suppress the DO NOT TOUCH / SWIPE NOW cues),
`VFS_SKIP_17`, `VFS_NO_REHANDSHAKE`, `VFS_REOPEN_SETCONFIG`, `VFS_HP_RESUME`,
`VFS_DUMP_SLICES=<dir>` (write each command's raw EP2 slice as `NN_raw.bin`;
calibration sweep frames are idx 6..12, plaintext), `VFS_NO_CALIB` (replay the
recorded calibration values instead of computing them — A/B diagnostic).
Most are leftovers from the re-enumeration investigation and are inert on the
happy path; kept for regression probing.
